Collaborating Theses:
1.	Edutainment (my part): integrate Moodle LMS, Tvheadend IPTV, FreePBX VoIP into a unified platform
2.	SSO (teammate): build Keycloak-based single-sign-on for all services
3.	Monitoring (teammate): deploy network & service monitoring (Zabbix/Nagios, stress-testing, pentesting)
________________________________________
1. High-Level Architecture
•	Backend Services
o	Moodle (Docker on Proxmox) for courses & materials
o	Tvheadend (Docker) for IPTV streaming (HLS profiles via /stream/channel/<UUID>?profile=pass)
o	FreePBX (SNGX VM) for WebRTC voice calls
•	SSO Layer
o	Keycloak realm “S4RAS” issues OIDC tokens to Portal & backends
•	Portal Frontend (teammate) in React/Vue/Angular:
o	Classroom → Moodle via OIDC & Web-Service tokens
o	NexaPlay → IPTV (fetch channel list + embed HLS.js video)
o	Chat → VoIP (JsSIP + WSS to FreePBX)
•	Monitoring (teammate) tracks CPU, memory, bandwidth, QoS (latency, jitter, packet loss)
________________________________________
2. Key Steps I’ve Completed (Edutainment Backend)
1.	Deploy & Configure
o	docker run linuxserver/tvheadend, map M3U playlist (iptv-dummy.m3u served by Python HTTP server) → scan, map “Big Buck Bunny” & “Channel Edu 1” → channel UUIDs:

o	Initialized Vite/React project (npm create vite@latest nexaplay).
o	Installed hls.js.
o	Wrote NexaPlay.jsx to fetch channel grid (/api/channel/grid?all=1) and render HLS player.
I have not yet tackled Step 4: the detailed plan to build the NexaPlay front-end in VS Code and integrate with SSO.
Please provide:
1.	A day‐by‐day plan for all step, broken into concrete tasks (e.g. “Day 1: Set up Vite with SSO client plugin,” “Day 2: Build channel‐list service with Keycloak token,” etc.). 15 days left to to this undergrad thesis
2.	Code snippets or tool recommendations for integrating OIDC login (Keycloak) into the React/Vite NexaPlay app.
3.	Any fallback strategies if CORS or auth‐token issues arise.
4.	Keycloak in my friend thesis is already connected to nextcloud
Finally, do you have your own suggested plan or best practices for Step 4 that I should consider?

_**Assistant**_

Okay, I've reviewed the extensive context you've provided about your S4RAS project, your specific "Edutainment" thesis, and your progress so far. It's an ambitious and interesting project!

You're now at Step 4, focusing on building the NexaPlay frontend with React/Vite, integrating it with Keycloak for SSO, and connecting to your Tvheadend backend for IPTV streaming. You have 15 days left, which is a tight but achievable timeline for a focused effort on this specific module.

Let's break down a plan and provide the guidance you're looking for.

### 1. Suggested 15-Day Plan for NexaPlay Frontend (Step 4)

This plan assumes you'll dedicate focused time each day. Some tasks might take less or more time depending on your familiarity with the technologies.

**Phase 1: Setup & Core Authentication (Days 1-4)**

*   **Day 1: Project Setup & Keycloak Integration (Foundation)**
    *   **Task 1:** Review your existing Vite/React project (`nexaplay`). Ensure linters (ESLint) and formatters (Prettier) are set up for code quality.
    *   **Task 2:** Install Keycloak adapter for React: `npm install @react-keycloak/web keycloak-js`.
    *   **Task 3:** Initialize Keycloak in your `main.jsx` or `App.jsx`. Configure it with your Keycloak server details (URL, realm, client ID).
    *   **Task 4:** Create basic protected routes. Users should be redirected to Keycloak login if not authenticated.
    *   *Goal:* Basic app structure where users can log in via Keycloak.

*   **Day 2: Login/Logout UI & Token Management**
    *   **Task 1:** Implement UI components for Login/Logout buttons.
    *   **Task 2:** Display basic user information from the Keycloak token (e.g., username) after login.
    *   **Task 3:** Understand how to access the Keycloak token within your components (the `@react-keycloak/web` library will help here).
    *   *Goal:* Functional login/logout, and ability to access user identity.

*   **Day 3: Basic Layout & Navigation**
    *   **Task 1:** Design and implement a simple layout for NexaPlay (e.g., header with user info/logout, main content area for channels and player).
    *   **Task 2:** Set up basic client-side routing if you plan to have multiple views within NexaPlay (e.g., `react-router-dom`). For a simple IPTV player, this might be minimal.
    *   *Goal:* A presentable shell for the application.

*   **Day 4: Environment Configuration & API Service Structure**
    *   **Task 1:** Move Keycloak configuration and Tvheadend API base URL to environment variables (`.env` file).
    *   **Task 2:** Create a dedicated service module (e.g., `services/tvheadendApi.js`) to handle API calls to Tvheadend. This module will be responsible for attaching the Keycloak auth token to requests.
    *   *Goal:* Configurable and organized API interaction setup.

**Phase 2: IPTV Core Functionality (Days 5-10)**

*   **Day 5: Fetching & Displaying Channel List**
    *   **Task 1:** Implement the function in `tvheadendApi.js` to fetch the channel list from Tvheadend (`/api/channel/grid?all=1`). Ensure the Keycloak token is sent in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
        *   **Note:** This assumes Tvheadend is configured to validate Keycloak OIDC tokens. If not, this is a critical point to resolve with your SSO teammate or by exploring Tvheadend's auth mechanisms (e.g., if it can use an external auth provider or if you need a small backend-for-frontend (BFF) to mediate).
    *   **Task 2:** Create a React component to display the fetched channels (e.g., a grid or list).
    *   *Goal:* Authenticated users can see a list of available channels.

*   **Day 6: Styling Channel List & Basic State Management**
    *   **Task 1:** Apply basic styling to the channel list for better UX.
    *   **Task 2:** Manage the state for the channel list (e.g., loading status, error messages, channel data) using React's `useState` and `useEffect`, or a simple state management library if preferred (React Context API can be good here).
    *   *Goal:* A user-friendly channel list.

*   **Day 7: Integrating HLS.js Player - Part 1 (Setup)**
    *   **Task 1:** Create a dedicated `VideoPlayer` React component.
    *   **Task 2:** Inside this component, set up `hls.js` to attach to a `<video>` element.
    *   **Task 3:** Implement logic to load a test HLS stream URL when the component mounts.
    *   *Goal:* Basic HLS video playback in a component.

*   **Day 8: Integrating HLS.js Player - Part 2 (Dynamic Stream Loading)**
    *   **Task 1:** Modify the `VideoPlayer` component to accept a channel's stream URL (e.g., `http://<host>:9981/stream/channel/<UUID>?profile=pass`) as a prop.
    *   **Task 2:** When a user clicks a channel in the list, pass the selected channel's stream URL to the `VideoPlayer` component.
        *   **Authentication for Stream URL:** Consider how the `user:pass` part of the stream URL is handled. If Tvheadend stream URLs require basic auth *in addition* to API calls being OIDC protected, you'll need a strategy. Ideally, if the API calls are OIDC authenticated, the stream URLs provided by the API might not need separate basic auth, or Tvheadend is configured to accept the OIDC token for streams too. Clarify this. If it still needs `user:pass`, you might need to securely fetch these or embed them if this is a trusted environment (less ideal).
    *   *Goal:* Users can click a channel, and the video plays.

*   **Day 9: Player Controls & Error Handling**
    *   **Task 1:** Enhance the `VideoPlayer` with basic custom controls if needed, or ensure native controls are well-styled.
    *   **Task 2:** Implement error handling for HLS.js (e.g., stream not found, decoding errors) and display user-friendly messages.
    *   **Task 3:** Add error handling for API calls (e.g., Tvheadend API down, auth failures).
    *   *Goal:* Robust player and API interaction.

*   **Day 10: Refinement and UI/UX Polish**
    *   **Task 1:** Review the overall UI/UX. Improve styling, add loading indicators, and ensure a smooth user experience.
    *   **Task 2:** Ensure responsiveness if it's a requirement.
    *   *Goal:* A polished-looking and usable application.

**Phase 3: Testing & Documentation (Days 11-15)**

*   **Day 11: Functional Testing**
    *   **Task 1:** Thoroughly test all functionalities: login, logout, channel listing, channel selection, video playback, error states.
    *   **Task 2:** Test with different channels, including your "Big Buck Bunny" & "Channel Edu 1".
    *   *Goal:* Identify and fix bugs.

*   **Day 12: Cross-browser/Cross-device Testing (Basic)**
    *   **Task 1:** Test on a couple of different modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox).
    *   **Task 2:** If possible, check basic usability on a different screen size (e.g., using browser developer tools).
    *   *Goal:* Ensure broader compatibility.

*   **Day 13: Integration Testing with SSO Team**
    *   **Task 1:** Coordinate with your SSO teammate to ensure the Keycloak integration is working as expected from end-to-end.
    *   **Task 2:** Test token refresh mechanisms if implemented/needed.
    *   *Goal:* Smooth SSO experience.

*   **Day 14: Code Cleanup & Basic Documentation**
    *   **Task 1:** Refactor code for clarity and efficiency. Remove console logs, unused code.
    *   **Task 2:** Add comments to complex parts of the code.
    *   **Task 3:** Write a brief `README.md` for NexaPlay: how to set it up, configure environment variables, and run it.
    *   *Goal:* Maintainable and understandable codebase.

*   **Day 15: Final Review & Buffer**
    *   **Task 1:** Final review of the application against your requirements.
    *   **Task 2:** Use this day as a buffer for any pending tasks or unexpected issues.
    *   **Task 3:** Prepare a short demo.
    *   *Goal:* Thesis deliverable ready.

### 2. Code Snippets & Tool Recommendations for OIDC (Keycloak) Integration

**Tool:**
*   `@react-keycloak/web`: This is the most common library for integrating React applications with Keycloak. It provides hooks and components to manage authentication state.
*   `keycloak-js`: The core JavaScript adapter, used by `@react-keycloak/web`.

**Example Snippets (Conceptual):**

**a. Initialize Keycloak (`main.jsx` or `App.jsx`):**
I will use the `edit_file` tool to create a conceptual `main.jsx` (or your entry point file) with Keycloak initialization.
This example shows how to initialize the Keycloak provider. You'll need to create a `keycloak.js` file to configure your Keycloak instance.

First, create `src/keycloak.js`:


---

```diff
- 
+ import Keycloak from 'keycloak-js';
+ 
+ // Configure your Keycloak instance
+ const keycloak = new Keycloak({
+   url: import.meta.env.VITE_KEYCLOAK_URL, // e.g., 'http://localhost:8080/auth' or 'http://localhost:8080/' if using Keycloak > 17
+   realm: import.meta.env.VITE_KEYCLOAK_REALM, // e.g., 'S4RAS'
+   clientId: import.meta.env.VITE_KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID, // e.g., 'nexaplay-frontend'
+ });
+ 
+ export default keycloak; 
```

---

Now, I'll edit your `src/main.jsx` (assuming this is your Vite project's entry point, adjust if it's different e.g. `src/index.jsx`) to wrap your App with the KeycloakProvider.


---

```diff
- import { StrictMode } from 'react'
- import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'
- import './index.css'
- import App from './App.jsx'
- 
- createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
-   <StrictMode>
-     <App />
-   </StrictMode>,
- )
+ import React from 'react';
+ import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
+ import App from './App';
+ import './index.css'; // Assuming you have a global CSS file
+ import { ReactKeycloakProvider } from '@react-keycloak/web';
+ import keycloak from './keycloak';
+ 
+ const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
+ 
+ const LoadingComponent = () => <div>Loading Keycloak...</div>;
+ 
+ // Handle Keycloak events (optional, for logging or advanced handling)
+ const onKeycloakEvent = (event, error) => {
+   console.log('onKeycloakEvent', event, error);
+ };
+ 
+ const onKeycloakTokens = (tokens) => {
+   console.log('onKeycloakTokens', tokens);
+   // You can store tokens here if needed, though the library often handles it.
+   // Example: localStorage.setItem('kc_token', tokens.token);
+ };
+ 
+ root.render(
+   <React.StrictMode>
+     <ReactKeycloakProvider
+       authClient={keycloak}
+       initOptions={{
+         onLoad: 'login-required', // Or 'check-sso'
+         // silentCheckSsoRedirectUri: window.location.origin + '/silent-check-sso.html' // if using silent check sso
+       }}
+       LoadingComponent={<LoadingComponent />}
+       onEvent={onKeycloakEvent}
+       onTokens={onKeycloakTokens}
+     >
+       <App />
+     </ReactKeycloakProvider>
+   </React.StrictMode>
+ );
  
```

---

Make sure to create your `.env` file in the root of your `nexaplay` project with your Keycloak details:
```
VITE_KEYCLOAK_URL=http://your-keycloak-server/auth
VITE_KEYCLOAK_REALM=S4RAS
VITE_KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID=your-nexaplay-client-id
VITE_TVHEADEND_API_URL=http://your-tvheadend-host:9981/api
```
*Note:* For Keycloak versions 17+, the URL might not include `/auth`. Adjust `VITE_KEYCLOAK_URL` accordingly. Your Keycloak client (`your-nexaplay-client-id`) needs to be configured in the `S4RAS` realm with appropriate redirect URIs (e.g., `http://localhost:5173/*` for Vite default dev server).

**b. Using Keycloak in a component (`NexaPlay.jsx` or a new component):**

I will edit `src/NexaPlay.jsx` to show how to use the `useKeycloak` hook.


---

```diff
- 
+ import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
+ import { useKeycloak } from '@react-keycloak/web';
+ import Hls from 'hls.js';
+ 
+ // Assume tvheadendApi.js exists in a services folder
+ // Example: import { getChannels } from './services/tvheadendApi';
+ 
+ // Mock API call for now
+ const fetchChannelsFromApi = async (token) => {
+   const tvheadendApiUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_TVHEADEND_API_URL || '/api'; // Default to /api if not set
+   console.log('Fetching channels with token:', token ? token.substring(0, 20) + '...' : 'No Token');
+   try {
+     const response = await fetch(`${tvheadendApiUrl}/channel/grid?all=1`, {
+       headers: {
+         'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
+       },
+     });
+     if (!response.ok) {
+       throw new Error(`Network response was not ok: ${response.status} ${response.statusText}`);
+     }
+     const data = await response.json();
+     // Tvheadend API for channel/grid returns an object with an 'entries' array
+     return data.entries || []; 
+   } catch (error) {
+     console.error('Failed to fetch channels:', error);
+     // In a real app, you'd set an error state here to display to the user
+     return []; // Return empty array on error
+   }
+ };
+ 
+ function NexaPlay() {
+   const { keycloak, initialized } = useKeycloak();
+   const [channels, setChannels] = useState([]);
+   const [selectedChannelUrl, setSelectedChannelUrl] = useState(null);
+   const videoRef = React.useRef(null);
+ 
+   useEffect(() => {
+     if (initialized && keycloak.authenticated) {
+       fetchChannelsFromApi(keycloak.token).then(setChannels);
+     }
+   }, [initialized, keycloak]);
+ 
+   useEffect(() => {
+     let hls;
+     if (selectedChannelUrl && videoRef.current) {
+       if (Hls.isSupported()) {
+         hls = new Hls();
+         hls.loadSource(selectedChannelUrl);
+         hls.attachMedia(videoRef.current);
+         hls.on(Hls.Events.MANIFEST_PARSED, () => {
+           videoRef.current.play();
+         });
+       } else if (videoRef.current.canPlayType('application/vnd.apple.mpegurl')) {
+         videoRef.current.src = selectedChannelUrl;
+         videoRef.current.addEventListener('loadedmetadata', () => {
+           videoRef.current.play();
+         });
+       }
+     }
+     return () => {
+       if (hls) {
+         hls.destroy();
+       }
+     };
+   }, [selectedChannelUrl]);
+ 
+   if (!initialized) {
+     return <div>Loading authentication...</div>;
+   }
+ 
+   const handleChannelSelect = (channel) => {
+     // Construct the stream URL. This might need adjustment based on your Tvheadend setup.
+     // The user:pass part is tricky. If Tvheadend is fully OIDC protected, this might not be needed
+     // or the API provides a full authenticated URL. For now, assuming it can be constructed or fetched.
+     // Example: http://user:pass@TVH_IP:9981/stream/channel/<UUID>?profile=pass
+     // You have UUIDs: 78210b8e5bf423d9130f46be9d9e07f4, 2e05ef52bdbff43fbf74f102c1273ddf
+     // This URL needs to be accessible by the client and might have CORS issues if not configured on Tvheadend.
+     const streamBaseUrl = (import.meta.env.VITE_TVHEADEND_API_URL || '').replace('/api',''); //e.g. http://10.3.132.68:9981
+     // This is a placeholder. You'll need actual logic to get the correct UUID and credentials/auth method for stream URLs
+     if (channel.uuid) {
+         // Assuming your channel object from /api/channel/grid has a uuid and name
+         // The stream URL might require specific auth. The original test used user:pass in the URL.
+         // If Tvheadend is not configured for OIDC on stream paths, this is a challenge.
+         // For now, let's assume the stream URL is something like this:
+         const streamUrl = `${streamBaseUrl}/stream/channel/${channel.uuid}?profile=pass`;
+         console.log(`Selected channel: ${channel.name}, Stream URL: ${streamUrl}`);
+         setSelectedChannelUrl(streamUrl);
+     } else {
+         console.error('Channel UUID is missing', channel);
+     }
+   };
+ 
+   return (
+     <div>
+       <h1>NexaPlay - IPTV</h1>
+       {!keycloak.authenticated && (
+         <button type="button" onClick={() => keycloak.login()}>
+           Login
+         </button>
+       )}
+ 
+       {keycloak.authenticated && (
+         <div>
+           <p>
+             Welcome, {keycloak.tokenParsed?.preferred_username || 'User'}!
+             <button type="button" onClick={() => keycloak.logout()} style={{ marginLeft: '10px' }}>
+               Logout
+             </button>
+           </p>
+           
+           <h2>Channels</h2>
+           {channels.length === 0 && <p>Loading channels or no channels available...</p>}
+           <ul>
+             {channels.map((channel) => (
+               <li key={channel.uuid} onClick={() => handleChannelSelect(channel)} style={{ cursor: 'pointer' }}>
+                 {channel.name} (Enabled: {channel.enabled ? 'Yes' : 'No'}, Number: {channel.number})
+               </li>
+             ))}
+           </ul>
+ 
+           {selectedChannelUrl && (
+             <div>
+               <h2>Now Playing</h2>
+               <video ref={videoRef} controls style={{ width: '80%', height: 'auto' }} />
+             </div>
+           )}
+         </div>
+       )}
+     </div>
+   );
+ }
+ 
+ export default NexaPlay; 
```

---

The changes to `src/App.jsx` would be to simply render `NexaPlay` or integrate it into your existing App structure. If `NexaPlay.jsx` is meant to be the main content of `App.jsx` when the user is authenticated, you would adjust `App.jsx` accordingly. For simplicity, I've put most logic into `NexaPlay.jsx`.

### 3. Fallback Strategies for CORS or Auth-Token Issues

*   **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) Issues:**
    *   **Problem:** Your React app (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`) tries to fetch data from Tvheadend (e.g., `http://10.3.132.68:9981`) and the browser blocks it due to security policies.
    *   **Solution 1 (Preferred): Configure Tvheadend Server:**
        *   Tvheadend needs to send `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` headers in its HTTP responses. For example, `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:5173` (for development) or `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` (less secure, allows any origin).
        *   It might also need `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` (e.g., `GET, POST, OPTIONS`) and `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` (e.g., `Authorization, Content-Type`).
        *   How to configure this depends on Tvheadend. Check its documentation or community forums. Sometimes a reverse proxy like Nginx or Apache in front of Tvheadend is used to manage CORS headers.
    *   **Solution 2 (Development Only): Vite Proxy:**
        *   Vite's development server can proxy requests. In `vite.config.js`:
            ```javascript
            // vite.config.js
            import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
            import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';

            export default defineConfig({
              plugins: [react()],
              server: {
                proxy: {
                  '/api': { // Or whatever base path your Tvheadend API uses
                    target: 'http://10.3.132.68:9981', // Your Tvheadend URL
                    changeOrigin: true,
                    secure: false, // If Tvheadend uses self-signed SSL
                    // rewrite: (path) => path.replace(/^\/api/, '') // If you want to remove /api prefix when proxying
                  }
                }
              }
            });
            ```
        *   Then in your frontend, you'd fetch from `/api/channel/grid` instead of the full Tvheadend URL.
    *   **Solution 3 (Backend-for-Frontend - BFF):** If you build a small backend service for NexaPlay, the frontend calls your BFF (same origin, no CORS), and the BFF calls Tvheadend (server-to-server, no CORS). This is more complex to set up.

*   **Auth-Token Issues:**
    *   **Token Not Sent / Incorrectly Sent:**
        *   Ensure `keycloak.token` is available and valid before making API calls.
        *   Correctly attach the token: `Authorization: Bearer ${keycloak.token}`.
    *   **Token Expired:**
        *   `@react-keycloak/web` usually handles token refresh automatically if your Keycloak client is configured for it (offline access scope often needed for refresh tokens).
        *   Monitor `onTokens` callback from `ReactKeycloakProvider` to see token updates.
        *   If tokens expire and are not refreshed, Keycloak should redirect to login or `keycloak.updateToken(minValidity)` can be called to try refreshing.
    *   **Tvheadend Doesn't Recognize Token (401/403 Errors):**
        *   **Crucial Check:** Verify Tvheadend is configured to validate JWTs from your Keycloak realm. This involves:
            *   Knowing Keycloak's public key or JWKS URI.
            *   Configuring Tvheadend to use this for verifying token signatures.
            *   Ensuring the "audience" (aud) claim in the JWT matches what Tvheadend expects (if it checks audience).
        *   If Tvheadend *only* supports Basic Auth for its API/streams:
            *   This is a significant challenge for direct OIDC integration.
            *   You might need a BFF that converts the OIDC session into Basic Auth credentials for Tvheadend (the BFF would securely store/manage these).
            *   Or, investigate if there are Tvheadend plugins for OIDC/JWT authentication.
    *   **Debugging Tokens:** Use tools like [jwt.io](https://jwt.io) to decode your tokens and inspect their claims (issuer, audience, expiry, roles, etc.).

### 4. Own Suggested Plan or Best Practices for Step 4

*   **Modular Components:** Keep React components small and focused on a single responsibility.
*   **State Management:** For this scale, React Context API combined with `useState` and `useReducer` might be sufficient. If complexity grows, consider Zustand or Redux Toolkit.
*   **Error Boundaries:** Implement React Error Boundaries to catch rendering errors in component subtrees and display a fallback UI.
*   **Centralized API Service:** As suggested (e.g., `services/tvheadendApi.js`), centralize API call logic. This makes it easier to manage headers, error handling, and base URLs.
*   **Asynchronous Operations:** Handle promises and async operations carefully (async/await, proper error catching).
*   **Environment Variables:** Absolutely use them (via Vite's `.env` files) for server URLs, Keycloak details, etc. Do not hardcode these.
*   **Tvheadend Stream Authentication:** The point about `http://user:pass@.../stream/...` is critical.
    *   If Tvheadend's API and stream URLs can both be secured purely via OIDC Bearer tokens (meaning Tvheadend checks this token for stream access too), that's the cleanest.
    *   If stream URLs still need `user:pass` after API calls are OIDC-secured, you need to determine where `user:pass` comes from. Is it the same for all users? Can it be derived from the Keycloak session? This needs clarification for secure implementation. Passing raw, static credentials from frontend to a stream URL is generally not recommended if the OIDC token *should* grant access.
*   **Collaboration with SSO Team:** Your SSO teammate is key. They manage Keycloak and should help with client configuration and understanding how backend services (like Tvheadend) are expected to integrate with Keycloak. The "OIDC Token Validation" step in your diagram for "CMS Backend" is exactly what's needed for Tvheadend as well if it's to understand Keycloak tokens.

### Regarding your Diagrams:

The diagrams are a good overview.
*   The first one shows "Portal Frontend" -> "URL Stream" -> "IPTV API". This is good. The "OIDC Auth" with Keycloak is also correctly placed.
*   The second diagram shows "NexaPlay" -> "Keycloak SSO" and "NexaPlay" -> "Tvheadend API". This is also correct. The "HLS.js Player" box under IPTV is something your NexaPlay frontend will *use*. The "Auth Token" from Tvheadend API is likely the OIDC token if integrated properly, or a session token Tvheadend itself might issue after validating the OIDC token.

The main challenge I foresee is ensuring Tvheadend can validate Keycloak tokens or having a clear strategy if it can't (like a small mediating backend service, though this adds to your workload). Discuss this with your SSO teammate.

You're on a good track by breaking this down. Remember to commit your code frequently and test small pieces as you build them. Good luck with your thesis! Let me know if you have more specific questions as you progress through these steps.

After you've digested this, you can share your thesis proposal if you'd like.

Thank you for sharing your thesis proposal (Judul TA No. 1) and the overview of the entire project (Keseluruhan 3 Judul TA). This provides excellent background and reinforces the goals and constraints of your S4RAS Edutainment module.

I've noted the key aspects, such as:
*   The focus on integrating LMS, VoIP, and IPTV for remote areas with limited infrastructure.
*   The use of Tvheadend for IPTV, and your target of 300 users with SD quality streaming.
*   The technological stack (Proxmox, Docker, FreePBX, Tvheadend, NextCloud).
*   The research and development methodology.

This information helps me better understand the context as we proceed with the plan for building the NexaPlay frontend. The 15-day plan and the code snippets I provided earlier for Keycloak integration and basic NexaPlay structure are still our primary focus for your immediate next steps.

I'm ready to continue guiding you through Step 4. Please let me know when you're ready to tackle the first few days of the plan, or if you have any specific questions based on the information I provided or your work on the initial setup!
